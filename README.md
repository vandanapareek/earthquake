# Earthquake Details
1. Web page is to integrate with an API to fetch earthquake information.
2. The page is to be mobile responsive.
3. The page is to display a Google map, plotting the earthquake locations as annotations / pins. 
4. When the user taps on an annotation it is to display the location and date/time in the callout.
5. Show the earthquake data (Title, Magnitude, URL, Location) in a table and sort by the
strongest magnitude first. You can use any table plugin.
